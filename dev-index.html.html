<p>  <Font Face= "Times New Roman">
<br><font size=5> I am Devansh Raina ,a seventh grader from the temple city 'Jammu'
<br> I am an extrovert and I talk a lot and often get into troubles because of it  
<br> My hobbies are playing cricket though the last time I went outside my home to play , was 11 months ago
<br> I like to participate in competitions beacuse 
<br> a) I get exposure and sometimes prize and medals also 
<br> b) Who dosen't love a free certificate 
<br> I get angry too soon and I do something which I regret in a minute ,I don't feel shy to say sorry
